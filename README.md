# IMDB-Movie-Reviews
This repository contains classification of Movie Reviews as 'Good' or 'Bad' from dataset provided by IMDB. 
The Machine Learning model uses Neural Networks via keras from Tensorflow.
I have been practicing Deep Learning from [Tensorflow Documentation Page](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification)
